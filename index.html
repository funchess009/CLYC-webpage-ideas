            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>The Cold Lake Youth Council is a youth-led, volunteer-based organization that acts as peer advocates on
                civic
                and social issues. It is composed of youth ages 12-18 who live, work or attend school in Cold Lake. The
                CLYC
                represents a community investing in its youth, who are engaged and feel valued in our community.

                The CLYC was developed in March 2014, and has been running strong since.

                To join CLYC or attend a meeting as a guest, please contact Cold Lake and District FCSS at 780-594-4495

                <p>Hi! I'm Maya. I'm in grade 10 at Assumption School, and this is my first year being a member of the
                    Cold Lake Youth Council. I'm a big fan of art (especially painting and drawing), and I love to read.
                    I enjoy going to Youth Council because it's a fun way to engage in our society and it's a wonderful
                    way to get to know and help the youth of our community. I've also learned a lot about
                    responsibility, and joining was a great way to get volunteer hours for school!</p>

                <p>Hi! My name’s Amanda. I'm currently in the 10th grade at Assumption High School. I’ve been in Youth
                    Council for a little less than a year and have been the deputy mayor since October 2023! I like
                    music, camping, and cats.</p>

                <p>Hi! My name is Jennica. I’m currently completing my grade 12 year at Assumption School, and this is
                    my second year with the Cold Lake Youth Council. I enjoy doing yoga, crocheting, cuddling with my
                    cats, and playing video games. My favorite things about being a part of the Cold Lake Youth Council
                    are: the satisfaction of seeing different projects come to life and being able to volunteer for so
                    many unique community events. Youth Council has helped me learn responsibility, sensitivity, and has
                    given me the opportunity to meet so many amazing new people!</p>

                <h3>Nicolas</h3>
                <p>Hello! My name is Nicolas. I’m in 9th grade at École Voyageur. I love coding, playing chess, and
                    piano. This is my first year in the Cold Lake Youth Council, and it’s been a great experience so
                    far. I’ve learned ways to be more involved in our community and connect to youth. Being part of the
                    youth council has also helped me to create projects in our community that I've wanted to do for a
                    while.</p>

                <p>Hello! I’m Julien, and I’m currently in 12th grade at École Voyageur. This is now my fourth year on
                    the Cold Lake Youth Council. I am passionate about all things science and plan to study engineering
                    in the fall. In my free time, I enjoy playing piano and reading. What I love about the Cold Lake
                    Youth Council is how it allows me to have a positive and lasting impact in my community through
                    projects and initiatives that I truly believe in.</p>

            <h3>Why scholarships are important?</h3>
            <p>
                Scholarships are money (Usually around 1-2,000 dollars but sometimes more or less) given to students
                from organisations to help pay off their tuition fees going into post-secondary schools. Some are
                through the government, local organisations, sometimes even universities or colleges themselves. To
                continue, scholarships can also be extremely useful if you're a student who might struggle getting into
                postsecondary for financial reasons, they provide a great pathway to higher education. To apply for most
                scholarships you have to either write an essay with who you are, how you're applicable to this
                scholarship and why you should win. Or in a few cases submit a video with the same information. Overall,
                scholarships are a small bit of money donated to a student based on academic success or other
                achievements to help them later in post secondary school.

            <h3>How to Volunteer Appropriately: </h3>
            <p>To volunteer appropriately, start by choosing a cause you care about. Make sure to understand the needs
                of the community or group you're helping and communicate clearly with the organization. You need to
                respect their guidelines, and approach volunteering with a read desire to make a difference. Your effort
                can make a meaningful impact.</p>
